              <h1>The 7:30 Commute</h1>
              <p>The New York morning is always a different kind of high. Your alarm pushes you out of bed and into the waking world. Rushing through the morning motions, you arrive at the train station just in time for the 7:30 commute. </p>
              <p>The 7:30 commute isn’t just a commute, it's a communal experience. Hundreds of people are forced onto the train, journeying from the comforts of home to the stress of work. It’s a voyage of both mind and body, where each New Yorker is in their own world contemplating the day ahead.</p>
              <p>	You’d think that familiar faces would appear taking the same train every day, but you don’t. One day your train is empty, but the next you're crammed in like a sardine. The inconsistencies are never-ending, signal delays, rerouted trains, and a train schedule that is never followed.</p>
              <p>	The other day you rode the B train down past Seventh Avenue. On the other side was a guy with a motorcycle he had brought down three flights of stairs. You were transfixed by the strange sight, but everyone around didn’t care; this was just part of a normal commute for all of them. The train is aggressive, screeching around corners as it tosses back and forth. Rumbles penetrate through your loud music and noise suppressing earbuds. All around people collide as the car shakes, not even looking up from their phones. The mumbled apologies fall onto deaf ears, neither person listening to what is said.             </p>
              <p>	The morning commute is a safe space to practice one of the most important New York skills, being aware while unaware. Every single person on the train is absent, away from their bodies. In their own world, they blast music or a podcast to drown out the noise. Others have their eyes closed or locked onto phones throughout the entire ride. Some New Yorkers are bold, I’m sure you see at least one each morning. The brave souls who sleep, relying on their innate sense of the train to wake them. Their skills are worth admiring, the veteran New York train sleepers. They’ve perfected the skills all of us are learning here.            </p>
              <p>	You are no exception from the rabble, mind drifting away to the future, the test coming up in chemistry, the homework you have to do for calculus, this paper you still need to plan out in your head. As the train crosses the bridge, you could see the entire Manhattan skyline come into view, if you would just look up. But you don’t, your perception only notes what's important to you, the seat that opens up so you can do homework, the station name that tells you to get off in three stops. Everything else just passes you by.            </p>
              <p>	You learn to tune out the distraction here on the 7:30 commute. The humming of the buzzing city is a dull background noise in your mind. You're barely cognizant of the wrappers scattered along the platform and the rats running across the track. You step over the filth and travel up the grimy escalator. Walking out onto the street you step past the trash and dead rats on the ground, there's a bundle of clothes against a wall - or is it a person?  There is a construction site across the street and a rushing bicyclist almost hit by a car, your brain notices them, but you do not.            </p>
              <p>It makes it so that everything that's happening is really nothing at all. The sights that overwhelm tourists, all noted and disregarded in milliseconds. At the start of the day, the 7:30 commute has already prepared you with the skills you’ll need. The screams of the kids outside during a test, the honking of midday traffic outside of the office, or the crowd of people rushing around Times Square, are nothing compared to what you’ve already faced. You’ll stare out into the city, filtering out all the details, and be left wondering why anyone would think the city was chaotic at all.</p>
